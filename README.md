# Recipe App

This project represents an effort to experiment with web development while engaging with the challenges of processing unstructured data. My primary aim was to explore the integration of backend, database, and web scraping technologies in a cohesive application.

## What I Did

- **Backend with Flask**:  
  Flask served as the backbone of the application, handling routing and enabling dynamic content delivery. It provided the framework for creating a functional and responsive web application.

- **Database Management with SQL**:  
  I used a relational database to store and organize recipe data efficiently. SQL allowed me to perform structured queries, which helped manage the complexities of handling various types of recipe information.

- **Web Scraping with Playwright**:  
  To populate the application with data, I utilized Playwright to scrape recipes from food.com. This process involved managing and processing unstructured web data into a structured format usable by the application.

- **Limitations**:  
  While the app allows users to browse and search recipes, I have not yet implemented a recommendation system. Adding this feature would involve designing algorithms that analyze user behavior or preferences to provide tailored suggestions.

## Motivation

The project was an opportunity to:
- Work with unstructured data and transform it into something useful.
- Develop skills in integrating web scraping tools with backend services and databases.
- Create a functional application that bridges different technologies and workflows.

This app is an ongoing learning experience, with room for improvement and expansion.
