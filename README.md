# Recipe App

This project is a personal experiment in building a functional and flexible recipe application. The primary goal was to explore full-stack web development while working with unstructured data from the web.

## What I Did

- **Backend with Flask**:  
  I used Flask to build the backend of the application, handling routing and serving dynamic recipe content.
  
- **Database Management with SQL**:  
  Recipes and user-related data are stored in a SQL database, allowing for efficient querying and data persistence.

- **Web Scraping with Playwright**:  
  I utilized Playwright to scrape recipe data from food.com, handling unstructured formats and converting them into a usable structure for the app.

- **No Recommendation System Yet**:  
  While the app currently allows users to browse and interact with recipes, I havenâ€™t implemented the recommendation algorithm yet. This will likely be a next step in development.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to practice:
- Integrating multiple technologies into a cohesive application.
- Handling messy, real-world data and converting it into structured information.
- Building a user-facing app while balancing backend complexity.
